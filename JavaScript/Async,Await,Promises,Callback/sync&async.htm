    <h1>Synchronous and Asynchronous in JavaScript</h1>
    <h3>Synchronous</h3>
    <p>Synchronous means the code runs in a particular sequence of instructions given in the program. Each instruction waits for the previous instruction to complete its execution.</p>
    
    <h3>Asynchronous</h3>
    <p>Due to Synchronous programming, sometimes the important instructions get blocked due to some previous instructions, which causes a delay in UI. So Asynchronous code execution allows to <br>execute next instructions immediately and doesn't block the flow.</p>

    <h3>Async-Await</h3>
    async function always returns a promise. <br>
    <b>async</b>function myFunc(){...} <br>
    await pauses the execution of its surrounding async function until the promise is settled. <br>
